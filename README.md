# Solar-Radiation-Prediction-
Solar Radiation Prediction using Python
Conducted K-NN, Ridge, Random Forrest, and Lasso regression algorithms to predict solar radiation
levels and determine the importance of each feature from a given a dataset. The data was collected from the HI-SEAS (Hawai’i Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) observatory located near the top of Mauna Loa volcano on Hawai’i Island. The data is from Kaggle and was first utilized for a Nasa Hackathon event for solar radiation predictions. Each piece of data was collected from September to December of 2016 and recordings were taken about every 5 minutes during that time frame giving us an ample amount of data to make predictions.
